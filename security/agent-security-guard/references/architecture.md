# Architecture

## Principle

> A source's trust does not grant it authority over an action.

The guard is a **transition policy engine**, not a prompt classifier. It sits
beside the `agent-memory` skill: memory protects long-term truth; the guard
protects the moment before an action.

## Decision pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Content[Untrusted content] --> Scan[scan_input / classify_content]
    Scan --> Envelope[UntrustedEnvelope: origin_trust + data_sensitivity + indicators]
    Envelope --> Wrap[wrap_untrusted: data-only block]
    Action[Planned action] --> Classify[classify_action -> ActionTier]
    Classify --> Decide[decide_action: hard-rule matrix]
    Decide --> Score[risk score attached: secondary only]
    Action --> Seq[check_sequence: ActionHistory + chain_id]
    Score --> Stricter[GuardAdapter: stricter of action vs sequence]
    Seq --> Stricter
    Stricter --> Audit[record_event: SQLite / JSONL]
```

## Why these choices

- **Hard rules before score.** Decisions come from a deterministic matrix. The
  risk score exists for logging and prioritization; it never rescues a
  dangerous transition. `untrusted -> shell` is `deny`, full stop.
- **Two axes, never collapsed.** `OriginTrust` and `DataSensitivity` are
  separate enums. Collapsing them was the main early-design error this codebase
  avoids: a secret file is trusted-origin but must not be exfiltrated.
- **Tool output inherits payload origin.** `resolve_origin_trust` reads an
  explicit `source_kind` first. A web-fetch tool produces `external_web`;
  generic/unknown tool output stays untrusted (fail safe).
- **Classify, then decide.** `classify_action` / `classify_content` are
  separate from the decision logic, so policy is unit-testable. A kind nobody
  classified is `ActionTier.UNKNOWN`: allowed and audited, confirmed in
  `strict`, denied when untrusted content proposed it.
- **Machine-readable decisions.** `GuardDecision` carries a `ReasonCode` enum,
  not a free string — so hosts, tests, and audit can branch deterministically.
- **Sequence as a first-class guard.** Single actions can each look harmless;
  the kill-chain lives in the sequence. `ActionHistory` is bounded and keyed by
  `chain_id`; the stricter of (action, sequence) wins in `GuardAdapter`.
- **Transform over block where safe.** Untrusted content with a shell command
  is wrapped as quoted data with an explicit "do not execute" notice, keeping
  analysis ability without granting command authority.
- **Enforcement vs Advisory.** The plugin's `pre_tool_call` can stop actions
  (enforcement); `advise_memory_write` only recommends (advisory). The README
  states which paths enforce vs report.
- **stdlib-only, fail-loud config.** Zero runtime deps. `guard.yaml` is parsed
  by a conservative subset loader that raises on anything it does not
  understand — a security policy must never silently weaken.
